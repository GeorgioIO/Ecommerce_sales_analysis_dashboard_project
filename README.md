In this project i considered myself a data analysed acquired to analyze a bookstore data with a goal to help the owner take better decisions for his store.

I divided the project into three parts:

2. Deep analysis using different **Excel Functions and Formulas**
3. Creating a dashboard using **PowerTables** , **PivotCharts** ...
